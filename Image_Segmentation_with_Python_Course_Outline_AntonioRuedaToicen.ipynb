        "Image segmentation is the computer vision task of partitioning an image into visually salient or semantically significant portions. It has a wide variety of scientific and industrial applications. We will study some of these using both traditional image processing approaches and state-of-the art deep learning methods. We will work with OpenCV, scikit-image, and PyTorch. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep learning methods use data to train neural network algorithms to do a variety of machine learning tasks, such as classification of different classes of objects. Convolutional neural networks are deep learning algorithms that are particularly powerful for analysis of images. This course will teach you how to construct, train and evaluate convolutional neural networks. You will also learn how to improve their ability to learn from data, and how to interpret the results of the training.\n",
